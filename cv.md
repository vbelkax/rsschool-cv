## About me
Interested in solving difficult tasks. While learning in law college, started programming at lessons and decided to continue. The knowledges came in handy at work (oddly enough) and I liked it, so I decided to change the profession and start to study programming hard in order to find a job.
In my free time I like to surf the Internet, searching for some useful information or monitor changes in IT.
